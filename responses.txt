Part 1: the polynomial_zeros.ipynb does not appear in the commit because .ipynb files were added to .gitignore
Part 2: I would like Frank's branch to come back to the rational legendre branch, and not have separate workflows, to bring back Frank's work without conflicts I decided to remove Iris's work and then merge Frank's in. Frank had branched off before Iris made fixes, so I will honor that order and bring back his earlier fix instead
